# reactProject_2

This site is part two in series of React 'test' applications created to highlight React skills.

The site is simple but includes a number of calculators which are contained in an external javascript file to keep the 'business' logic separated from the 'presentational' logic.

The site also uses HTML5, CSS3 & SCSS.

The live site can be found at https://project2.patrickdobson.co.uk
